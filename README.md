# Burger Site

### Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Burger!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.
